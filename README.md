# Final-Project-CourseMea
Welcome to the Retail Sales Analysis project! This project is part of a Business Analytics Bootcamp, aimed at uncovering key business insights from a retail dataset using Python (EDA) and Power BI (Dashboard).

## Project Overview (The goal of this project):
- Explore and analyze a retail sales dataset from Kaggle
- Identify sales trends, descriptive statistics and data visualizations, and product performance
- Develop actionable insights for business decision-making
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for data visualization
  
## Dataset:
The dataset includes historical sales records from a retail store, including: Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount.
**Source:** Kaggle Retail Sales Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python:** Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard with filters and visual insights.
  
## Key Insights and Findings:
**1. Overall Performance Snapshot (KPIs):**
- Total Sales: The business has generated $456K in total sales.
- Quantity Sold: A total of 2,514 units have been sold.
- Total Transactions: There have been 1,000 individual transactions.
Insight: The average transaction value is approximately $456 ($456K / 1,000 transactions), indicating a relatively high average basket size.

**2. Sales Trends Over Time:**
- Monthly Sales Trend: Sales show a clear fluctuating pattern throughout the year. Sales start in January (37K), grow in February (44K), dip in March (29K), recover little in April (34K), reach the max in May (53K) and then show a general downward trend through mid-year (e.g., July 35K, August 37K). There's a noticeable recovery towards the end of the year, with sales picking up in October (47K) and December (45K).
Insight: The business experiences significant seasonality, with potential dips in mid-year and stronger performance at the beginning and end of the year. This suggests opportunities for targeted promotions during slower months and robust inventory planning for peak periods.
- Daily Sales Trends: Daily sales also exhibit significant fluctuations, with peaks and valleys within the month. Sales can vary widely, from lows around 10K-13K to highs around 25K.
Insight: Daily volatility requires flexible staffing and inventory management to respond to short-term demand shifts.

**3. Product Category Performance:**
Sales by Product Category (Donut Chart): 
- Clothing is the leading category, accounting for 34.1% of total sales (156K).
- Electronics is a very close second, contributing 34.4% (157K).
- Beauty accounts for 31.5% (144K). (Note: There might be a slight discrepancy in the K values shown on the donut chart vs. the percentage, but the percentages clearly indicate the distribution).
Insight: Clothing and Electronics are the primary revenue drivers, making them critical focus areas for continued growth and inventory investment. Beauty is a significant third, but with a smaller share.

**4. Sum of Quantity by Product Category (Bar Chart):**
- Clothing also leads in quantity sold with 894 units.
- Electronics is second with 849 units.
- Beauty is third with 771 units.
Insight: The quantity sold aligns with sales revenue, confirming that Clothing and Electronics are not only high-value but also high-volume categories.

**5. Interactive Filtering (Slicers):**
The presence of slicers for Product Category, Date, and Annual Sales allows users to dynamically filter the data, enabling deeper dives into specific segments or time periods.
Insight: The dashboard is designed for interactive exploration, empowering users to answer specific questions about different aspects of sales performance.
These insights provide a strong foundation for business decision-making, from inventory and marketing strategies to product assortment and pricing adjustments.
